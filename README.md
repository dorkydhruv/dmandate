## DMANDATE

DMANDATE is a Solana-based protocol for decentralized recurring payments. Users pre-approve a PDA to transfer tokens (e.g., USDC) without locking funds. A backend processes payments at scheduled intervals, ensuring self-custody and transparency. Ideal for subscriptions, salaries, and bills, DMANDATE offers a trustless, non-custodial alternative to traditional e-mandates.
